  Key Deliverables  
1. *Integrated Dataset*: Unified dataset prepared through data wrangling techniques.  
2. *Insightful Analysis*: Trends and relationships derived from the data.  
3. *Documentation*:  
   - A detailed Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.  
   - A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the objectives, methodology, and findings.
